"""
End-to-end tests for doffin MCP server.

These tests make actual HTTP requests to doffin.no to verify that the server
works correctly with the real API. They are marked as 'e2e' and can be run
separately from unit tests.

Note: These tests depend on external service availability and may be slower.
They should be run sparingly and preferably in CI/CD environments.
